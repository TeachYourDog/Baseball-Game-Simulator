# Baseball-Game-Simulator


The goal for this project is to generate a method of simulating the outcome of a baseball game utilizing statistics and lineups from teams. 

The roadmap is to built it from the inside out:
  1. At bat
  2. Half inning
  3. Full inning
  4. Full game
 
 
 
Each at bat can end in one of the following ways: 
  1. Strikeout (No distinction between called and swinging)
  2. Walk (Includes hit by ball and 4 balls)
  3. Ball in Play
  
  
  
If a ball is put in play:
  1. Caught out
  2. Makes it to base (Calculated using players OBP)
